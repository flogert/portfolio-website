    content: `At times, I remind myself to try and slow down time,
the thought catches me in front of a window,
or by the wooden bench at the park,
or when I see smiles all around.
It's cause I desire the daily rush to lessen,
with the joyful tranquility of the gifted present.
I see trees dancing with the wind,
I feel the love from warm hugs,
and I all I can do is take a snapshot,
truly embracing places and emotions,
as a beautiful part of humanity.`,

    content: `It all leads the same way,
            where the storms are of the past,
            and the time is gonna stay,
            frozen, broken in rust.

            If the melody of cry,
            is gonna echo in me,
            I ask for the sounds of life,
            to journey through eternity.

            Cause I know, the notes of silence,
            will fight, endure the deepest pain,
            and patience will be the guidance,
            for the joy that will remain.

            I feel the breath of harmony,
            as the world stops suddenly,
            a moment of relief charging deep,
            in the deepest mind to be.

            These sounds of life are the key,
            to be free, for once, to live,
            all the present, every second,
            how to love, how to give.`,

In a cosmic ballet grand,
A fleeting romance,
Written in the stellar sand.

Pink and purple hues,
Painting skies of endless night,
Chasing away blues,
With their soft and gentle light.`,

In a gravity embrace,
Moving fast and slow,
Through the vastness of space.

Tethered by a force,
Unseen but always there,
On a steady course,
With not a single care.`,
