            the thought catches me in front of a window,
            or by the wooden bench at the park,
            or when I see smiles all around.
            It's cause I desire the daily rush to lessen,
            with the joyful tranquility of the gifted present.
            I see trees dancing with the wind,
            I feel the love from warm hugs,
            and I all I can do is take a snapshot,
            truly embracing places and emotions,
            as a beautiful part of humanity.`,

    title: "Sounds of Life",
    content: `It all leads the same way,
            where the storms are of the past,
            and the time is gonna stay,
            frozen, broken in rust.

            If the melody of cry,
            is gonna echo in me,
            I ask for the sounds of life,
            to journey through eternity.

            Cause I know, the notes of silence,
            will fight, endure the deepest pain,
            and patience will be the guidance,
            for the joy that will remain.

            I feel the breath of harmony,
            as the world stops suddenly,
            a moment of relief charging deep,
            in the deepest mind to be.

            These sounds of life are the key,
            to be free, for once, to live,
            all the present, every second,
            how to love, how to give.`,

    title: "Words",
    content: ` I can't stop thinking of words,
            these mysterious things that cross my mind,
            while they quickly dance around,
            faster than a gossip in a small town.

            There's the always powerful ones,
            as they echo throughout history,
            full of meaning and eternal glory,
            firmly standing for humanity.

            There's the warm ones,
            said as a greeting or a feeling,
            at a market or under the stars,
            planting smiles and warming hearts.

            Some others are left behind,
            with no empathy in mind,
            causing tears that start streams,
            tearing starts of pristine dreams.

            Many more are never spoken,
            perhaps to avoid a heart broken,
            but the true feelings will unfold,
            through a nervous twitch or a smiley face,
            somehow we can't escape, but embrace,
            our genuinely powerful emotions.
            And like the skies with the birds,
            we're connected with words,
            and more.`,

    title: "My Salmonberry",
    content: `Brand new journey in the valley,
            stardew morning calls my name,
            Shaking gently some salmonberry,
            as we accomplish through the day.

            Farming firstly, tending crops,
            petting chickens and the cat,
            collecting parsnip for the shop,
            to get some gold for a hat.

            Where's my pal, she still napping,
            we got a challenge for us ahead,
            "Fishing is hard" she says abruptly,
            "Let's go mining instead".

            Following me through the woods,
            "Take me hand", she says, "it's heavy",
            Foraging swiftly some nuts and berries,
            For the mine now we are ready.

            There's no slimes or pesty bugs,
            or bats and monsters to match our fierce,
            I say you can gather supplies,
            while I swing this sword of mine.

            I protect, you collect,
            eat salmonberries for energy,
            we leave the mine before sunset,
            our pockets full of harmony.

            But in real life it's coffee chats,
            as you joyfully share a story,
            I see your world full of coziness,
            It truly is my salmonberry.`,
